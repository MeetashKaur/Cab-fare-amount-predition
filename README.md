# Cab-fare-amount-predition
Problem Statement -
You are a cab rental start-up company. You have successfully run the pilot project and now want to launch your cab service across the country. You have collected the historical data from your pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for fare prediction. You need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city.

Number of attributes in the train dataset:
1.pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the cab ride started.

2.pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the cab ride started.

3.pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the cab ride started.

4.dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the cab ride ended.

5.dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the cab ride ended.

6.passenger_count - an integer indicating the number of passengers in the cab ride.

7.fare_amount- integer value indicating the fare amount for the certain values of above mentioned variables.

Train and test datasets are provided in the repository
